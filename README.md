This repo covers:
1. Our full process of exploratory data analysis.
2. [Streamlit app](https://lorria123-xuehua-luo-coffee-q0kfs7.streamlitapp.com/).

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dimitryzub/walmart-coffee-listings-from-500-stores

1. After simple data processing, we delete some unimportant data columns.
2. We used seaborn to analyze the relationship between variables.
3. Through iteration, we found the ranking of the most popular coffee types among consumers, among which the top three are medium roast /Dark Roast /Arabica.
4. In the app, you can select different sellers to view their coffee sales data, as well as the coffee titles with the highest ratings and most reviews.
5. We find that Walmart is the most popular seller of coffee.
6. ~300-500 grams is the most frequent weight.
7. More weight (grams) doesn't equal higher price.
  - A lower gram coffee may cost more than a higher gram coffee.
